# tknp clearance portal
The process is divided into Two major categories
Departmental Clearance - Form 2103
General clearance - Form 2102
further divied into two parts each.

# Departmental
Form 2103 A - Departmental Clearance
clear with all subject/unit tutors/lecturers
Number varies with number of units taken in the specified year of study.
My suggestion is all this functions be done by the Head of department since He/she keeps the departmental records of students and to prevent bias.

â€‹Form 2103 B - Departmental Liability
Generally filled by the HOD of the department. 

# General
Form 2102 A - Teaching Departments.
