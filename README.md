# Introduction
The clearence process is divided into Two major categories
- ###  Departmental Clearance - Form 2103
- ###  General clearance - Form 2102
further divied into two parts each.

# Departmental Clearance

## Form 2103 A - Department Clearance
clear with all subject/unit tutors/lecturers
Number varies with number of units taken in the specified year of study.
My suggestion is all this functions be done by the Head of department since He/she keeps the departmental records of students and to prevent bias.

## Form 2103 B - Department Liability
Generally filled by the HOD of the department. 

# General Clearance 
## Form 2102 A - Teaching Departments.
