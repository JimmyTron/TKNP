    <title>TKNP CLEARANCE PORTAL</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="bd-title" id="content">Introduction</h1>
        <p class="bd-lead">Student’s Clearance Portal is intended to help create efficiency, effectiveness of operations, cost effectiveness and it is also aimed explicitly at providing security and integrity of information related to all transactions by elimination of unauthorized access by the personnel to the records of transactions that have taken place.</p>
        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>The clearance process is divided into two major categories:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Departmental Clearance - Form 2103</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>General Clearance - Form 2102</p>
                </li>
            </ul> 
            
            The two are further  sub-divied into two parts each.</p>
            <h3 id="deparmental">Departmental Clearance</h3>
            <i><b>Form 2103 A</b> - Departmental Clearance</i>
            <p>clear with all subject/unit tutors/lecturers. The number varies with number of units taken in the specified year of study.
            My suggestion is all this functions be done by the Head of department since He/she keeps the departmental records of students and to prevent bias.</p>
            
            <i><b>Form 2103 B</b> - Departmental Liability</i>
            <p>Generally filled by the Head of Department of the department in cases where the student owes the Department.</p>​ 
            <h3 id="general">General Clearance</h3> 
            <i><b>Form 2102 A</b> - Teaching Departments</i>
            <p>we have close to 10 departments here including the one the student belongs to.
                <ul> Teaching Departments

            <i><b>Form 2102 B</b> - Non Teaching Departments.</i>
             <p>we have 9 departments and the National Library acts as the 9th whereby from the national library It is still valid it remains as it is by allowing the student to physically get a stamped slip.
                 <ul>Non Teaching Departments

            </p>
            
           <h3 id="finance">Finance Office</h3>
            <p>Finance Office only acts on completion of all other departments to give a charge sheet or just to clear the student.</p> 
          <h3 id="registry">Registry</h3> 
            <p>Finally the Registrar is handed the form and if everything is in place a slip/certificate is issued.</p>
